Nink saves the town!

All the men of the town were lured into the
Goblin king's dungeon by gold and fame!

You, Nink, must enter the dungeon to rescue
your husband and the men of the town.

But beware! They are very greedy and will
happily run off to get more gold.

You will get points for completing the
level with the most survivors carrying the
most gold in the least amount of time,
which will be submitted online.
