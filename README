Nink saves the town!

All the men of the town were lured into the
Goblin king's dungeon by gold and fame!

You, Nink, must enter the dungeon to rescue
your husband and the men of the town, before
the goblins eat them all!

But beware! They are very greedy and will
happily run off to get more gold. You can
call them to make them follow you again for
some time.

Goblins just like killing, they take 3 hits
to kill with any weapon.

You will get points for completing the
level with the most survivors carrying the
most gold in the least amount of time,
which will be submitted online.
